					<h2>Play alone or with friends!</h2>
					<p>NightRuder allows for an indepth single player mode where the user is taken on an adventure through the darkest of nights.... if you dare! If playing alone isn't your style then hop online and join up with friends to take down enemeies and face down the night terrors that lurk around every corner.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="article">
					<h2>Unique character classes</h2>
					<p>In NightRuder the player has the opportunity to select one of 10 different unique player classes each with their own style of gameplay and interaction. Each class comes equipped with their own weapons, skills and abilities, and hitpoints.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="article">
					<h2>World class development</h2>
					<p>NightRuder comes from the same creative talent that made Elden Ring (Yes THAT Elden Ring).... okay maybe it isn't the same people but they are definitely friends with those people. The gameplay is so intense it could only have come from the unhinged mind of Nebraska's game bad boy, Ron Ronaldson. Need we say more?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="article">
					<h2>A world unto itself</h2>
					<p>In NightRuder you will experience a game play that few others have been able to create. It entails an explorable environment as big as Yellowstone National Park. If that isn't enough the player is allowed to destroy and create map content while playing the game. Build on the existing universe by playing in the "expansion" mode that includes the ability to create entire new maps for play.</p>
				</div>
				<!-- question 6 -->
				<div class="article" id="roster">
					<h2>Development Team</h2>
					<p>The development team hails from Mount Olympus. Few know it but they were instrumental in the overthrow of the titans. Are they gods among mortals? We will leave it to the in-game exerpeince to do the talking on that matter. What users may not realize is that this game (another spoiler and warning) could ver well melt your face. How you may ask? That is a part of the trade secret and patented Face Melt Engine&copy;. This was developed completely in house for the purposes of NightRuder any claims that this is pirated technology from our competitors is currently subject to litigation and will not be discussed further.</p>
